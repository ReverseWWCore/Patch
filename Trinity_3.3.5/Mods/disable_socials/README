PURPOSE
  Disable /kiss, /dance, and /sexy commands.

STATUS
  Working as of: https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/commit/5365bd25fae59a6ae225534b779bd6c14779599a

DETAILS
  This is a very quick implementation that checks for socials based on magic numbers.
  If there is further interest it will eventually be moved to a database table so it
  can be more easily maintained. For now, though, this is simply a working proof of
  concept that you can disable /social commands on the client side.

INSTALL
  01 : Apply disable_socials.patch to TrinityCore folder.
  02 : Recompile source and enjoy.
